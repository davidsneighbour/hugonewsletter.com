The unofficial source for all the Hugo happenings around the Internet.

Hugo Newsletter is a curated list of Hugo releases, important Docs updates, new & updated themes, interesting discussions from the Hugo forums, and blog posts on Hugo from around the web. We're aiming for monthly updates starting with our first email in February.
