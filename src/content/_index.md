The unofficial source for all the Hugo happenings around the Internet.

Hugo Newsletter is a curated list of Hugo releases, important Docs updates, new & updated themes, interesting discussions from the Hugo forums, and blog posts on Hugo from around the web. A new issue is released on the first Monday of every month.

Feel free to (re)register while we are transitioning the project. The next Hugo Newsletter will be published as always on Monday, October 7th.
