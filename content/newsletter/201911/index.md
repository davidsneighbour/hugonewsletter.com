# Good day, *|FNAME|*!

Welcome to the November edition of **_The (unofficial) Hugo Newsletter_** on this beautiful and sunny first Monday this month.

<img data-file-id="3333097" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/d6f938e236a25dff84c3a6987/images/7b825b4f-dc2f-4141-895b-81182aff1aa8.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto;" />

In our second edition of news from the Hugoverse, and once again we bring you information about Hugo&#39;s new versions and Tipps and Tricks for your daily work with Hugo.

Now is by the way also <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/hugo-has-overtaken-jekyll/21581" target="_blank">the month that we will remember</a> because the <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo" target="_blank">Hugo repository on Github</a> now has more stars than the Jekyll repository. Congratulations to <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">all developers and contributors</a>&nbsp;but especially to <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/bep/summary" target="_blank">@bep</a>!&nbsp;ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

But enough celebrations! Let&#39;s dive in!

Patrick
