# Hi there, Guinea Pig!

<small>Disclaimer: [The Oxford Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/guinea_pig) defines a Guinea Pig as "A person or thing used as a subject for experiment." and I am using this term solely with this definition ;]</small>

Welcome to the October edition of **_The (unofficial) Hugo Newsletter_**. I am still changing diapers on all the super cool automatic features and the design (they looked so lovely in my head but putting them into an actually working Hugo layout seems to be peculiar), so this newsletter is more or less short and might look different than future issues. Let‚Äôs call this one "**_A soft opening_**".

Also, I was planning on writing an excellent and life-changing Op-Ed about how this newsletter will become a driving force and the most bestest newsletter of the Hugoverse, but first of all, that‚Äôs easy if there is only one newsletter and secondly I got no time for that ;)

So let‚Äôs dive into this months edition. I will add small-print explainers to all sections for the first few editions that explain what this section is about and how to contribute to each section.

In general, **_The (unofficial) Hugo Newsletter_** will give you an overview of what happened in the past month in the Hugoverse. Hugo updates, links to exciting tutorials or stuff that might be of interest.

That's all for now. Read on, young Padawan.
