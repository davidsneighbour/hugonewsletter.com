You are aware, that you can participate in creating this monthly newsletter? Good. [Check out our Github repository](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugonewsletter.com). Each months issue ([for example this current one](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugonewsletter.com/tree/master/content/2019/10)) has several data files where you can add links and information for our lists. It's as easy as opening either an issue or a pull request. If you want to add full articles or sections then feel free to open pull requests on that months `index.md`. Let us know about bugs, display problems, your millenial angst via [issues](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugonewsletter.com/issues). What could possibly go wrong? This newsletter is open for everyone. Just do it.
