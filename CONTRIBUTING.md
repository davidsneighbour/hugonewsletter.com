# Contributing to the Hugo Newsletter project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! :tada::+1: Following are some tips on getting the most out of contributing.

## Newsletter content

When you come across something interesting for the newsletter, you can let us know in various ways:

- Tweet [@HugoNewsletter](https://twitter.com/HugoNewsletter) on Twitter.
- Send Patrick (the project's owner) a DM on [the Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/pkollitsch).
- [Open a Github issue](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugonewsletter.com/issues/new).

We are working on automating things around the newsletter, so if you want to add a specific entry to the newsletter feel free to create a `myentryname.md` inside of the `content/yyyy/mm` folder. Where yyyy obviously is the year of the newsletter issue and mm the month of publication. I will create folders for the future newsletters in advanced time.

## Pull requests

- Smaller pull requests are always better. Typically one pull request per issue works well. This makes reviewing them easier for us, but also prevents you spend considerable time on something that doesn't get merged.
