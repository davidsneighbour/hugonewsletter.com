## Contributing to the Hugo Newsletter Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! :tada::+1: Following are some tips on getting the most out of contributing.

*   [Newsletter content](#newsletter-content)
*   [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)

### Newsletter Content

When you come across something interesting for the newsletter, you can let us know in different ways:

*   Tweet [@HugoNewsletter](https://twitter.com/HugoNewsletter) on Twitter.
*   Send Patrick a DM on [the Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/pkollitsch).
*   [Open a Github issue](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugonewsletter.com/issues/new).

We are working on automating the creation of the newsletter, so if you want to add a specific entry to the newsletter feel free to create a `myentryname.md` inside of the `content/yyyy/mm` folder. I will create folders for the future newsletters in advanced time.

### Pull Requests

Smaller pull requests are always better. Typically one pull request per issue works well. This makes reviewing them easier for us, but also prevents you from spending considerable time on something that doesn't get merged.
