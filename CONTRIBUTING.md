## Newsletter content
When you come across something interesting for the newsletter, you can let us know in various ways:

- Tweet [@HugoNewsletter](https://twitter.com/HugoNewsletter) on Twitter.
- Send Ricardio (the project's owner) a DM on [the Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/FelicianoTech).
- Send [an email](https://feliciano.tech/contact/) to Ricardio.
- [Open a Github issue](https://github.com/felicianotech/hugonewsletter.com/issues/new).

## Issues

- We encourage small, focused issues. We love to hear all your ideas and suggestions, but discussing them is often easier when you make separate issues for them.

## Pull requests

- Smaller pull requests are always better. Typically one pull request per issue works well. This makes reviewing them easier for us, but also prevents you spend considerable time on something that doesn't get merged.
