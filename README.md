# HugoNewsletter.com

Many of us frequently visit the [Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io) and absorb so much Hugo news and happenings. Even more so if you also follow [@GoHugo.io](https://twitter.com/GoHugoIO) on Twitter. But not everyone does or can keep up.

Luckily, the [Hugo Newsletter](http://hugonewsletter.com/) provides a monthly recap of everything Hugo. That means information about Hugo releases and notifications about important documentation updates. We'll also look at new Hugo themes and helpful discussions on the Hugo forum. Useful blog posts from around the Internet are also included in the newsletter.
